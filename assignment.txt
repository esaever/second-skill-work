Semantic and non-semantic elements are terms often used in the context of web development and HTML.

Semantic Elements:

Semantic elements are those HTML tags that clearly describe their meaning in a human-readable way.
These elements convey the purpose or meaning of the content they enclose, making the code more understandable for both developers and machines.
Examples of semantic elements include <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <main>, <time>, etc.
Semantic elements help improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of web pages.
Non-Semantic Elements:

Non-semantic elements are those HTML tags that do not inherently convey any meaning about the content they contain.
These elements are typically used for layout and formatting purposes.
Examples of non-semantic elements include <div>, <span>, <i>, <b>, <font>, <br>, <table>, <img>, etc.
While non-semantic elements are essential for structuring the layout and styling of web pages, they do not provide any contextual information about the content they enclose.
In summary, semantic elements are preferred in HTML because they provide meaning and context to the content, which improves accessibility, SEO, and code readability. Non-semantic elements, on the other hand, are primarily used for layout and presentation purposes.


A closing tag is used to denote the end of an element in HTML. It consists of the element name enclosed in angle brackets preceded by a forward slash. For example, <p> is an opening tag for a paragraph element, and </p> is its corresponding closing tag.
A self-closing tag, on the other hand, is used to represent an element that doesn't have any content inside it and doesn't need a closing tag. Instead, it ends with a forward slash before the closing angle bracket. For instance, <img src="image.jpg" /> is a self-closing tag for an image element.
In summary, the main difference is that closing tags are used to mark the end of an element with content, while self-closing tags are used for elements that don't contain any content.


Inline elements and block-level elements are two fundamental building blocks of HTML, each with its own behavior and properties:
Block-level Elements:
Block-level elements typically start on a new line and take up the full width available, pushing subsequent elements to a new line.
Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, etc.
Block-level elements can contain other block-level and inline elements.

Inline Elements:
Inline elements do not start on a new line; they flow within the content and only take up as much width as necessary.
Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <abbr>, <code>, etc.
Inline elements cannot contain block-level elements but can contain other inline elements.
